New PHP 7.0 - 7.2 Features for Versatile Collections PHP 7.2+
===============================================================
- https://gist.github.com/rotexdegba/2e04245570810ff05f571ab95cc4c728 new stuff in PHP 7.X
- Use Scalar type definitions in method parameters and return signature and get rid of code formerly used to check types (and the exceptions thrown when types are wrong)
    - Update unit test expecting those exceptions to no longer do so where appropriate they should expect \TypeError in those cases I guess
- Add declare strict types at the top of the different classes
- The spaceship operator is used for comparing two expressions. It returns -1, 0 or 1 when $a is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than $b. 
    - use where reasonable
- Use anonymous classes where reasonable
- Look at incorporating Closure::call() into places where Utils::bindObjectAndScopeToClosure & Utils::getClosureFromCallable are being called
    - Update Utils::bindObjectAndScopeToClosure removing PHP 5.6 related code
    - Utils::canReallyBind should no longer be needed for the php 7.2+ versions
- Use Generator Return Expressions and Generator delegation where appropriate
- No more polyfills needed for random_bytes() and random_int() i.e. paragonie/random_compat
 
Add them to https://github.com/rotexsoft/versatile-collections/issues moving forward.
